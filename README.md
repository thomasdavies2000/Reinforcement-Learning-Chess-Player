## Deep Reinforcement Learning Chess Player :chess_pawn: - University Assignment
#### Grade: 85%

One of the most challenging assignments I had across my 3 years at Uni. 

Implementing and evaluating two different Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Deep Q Learning and SARSA). The most challenging part of this assignment was implementing the algorithms without using any Deep Learning packages - for the forward and backword propagation only numpy was used.

The Chess board was reduced to a 4x4 board with 3 pieces.
