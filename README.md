## Deep Reinforcement Learning Chess Player :chess_pawn: - University Assignment
#### Grade: 85%

One of the most challenging assignments I had across my 3 years at Uni. 

Implementing and evaluating two different Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Deep Q Learning and SARSA). The most challenging part of this assignment was implementing the algorithms without using any Deep Learning packages - the forward and backward propagation over the neural network implemented only using numpy.

The Chess board was reduced to a 4x4 board with 3 pieces - Player 1 has a Queen and King and Player 2 has only a Queen. Reinforcement learning techniques train the agent (Player 1) to make the optimal move based on Player 2's position.
